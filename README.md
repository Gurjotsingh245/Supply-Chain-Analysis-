# Supply-Chain-Analysis-
Analysis of Startup's Supply Chain

### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights of the supply chain performance of a startup beauty products company. By analyzing various aspects of the supply chain, I seek to identify trends, make recomendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Source 
Attached is the data source I used for this project, called supply_chain_data.cvs


### Cost Analysis 

Average cost to produce a haircare product is $48, average cost to produce a skincare product is $48, while average cost to produce a cosmetic product is $43.
 
When we calculate profit of each product by subtracting costs from price, we find that currently haircare and skincare products are not profitable. Only cosmetics is profitable. 

Products that have the lowest manufacturing costs have the highest prices while products with the highest manufacturing costs have the lowest prices. This is an inverse relationship between manufacturing costs and product prices.

As this is a start-up beauty company, there might be more focus on revenue growth and market penetration. However, the company might need to kill off certain haircare and skincare products with high manufacturing costs and negative profitability in times of fiscal instability.

### Supply Chain Analysis 

Skincare products have the highest lead times at 16.7 days. Haircare products have lead times of 15.5 days. Cosmetics products have shortest lead times at 15.4 days. 

There is a positive correlation between lead times and availability. Products with the longest lead times have the highest availability. Products with the lowest lead times have the lowest availability. There is a positive correlation between lead times and stock levels. Products with the highest lead times have the highest stock levels. Hence, products with high lead times lowers demand, resulting in high stock levels and availability. 


### Logistics Analysis

In order of highest to lowest, the most used transportation modes are road, rail, air and sea.
Sea transportation has the lowest costs at an average of $417, while rail has the 2nd lowest transportation cost at $541.
Sea transportation has the lowest lead times, while rail has the 2nd lowest lead times. Hence, it makes sense to increase sea transportation usage, as it is currently the least used method of transportation. Likewise, increase the use of rail transportation.  

Route A is most commonly used, route B is middle, and route C is least commonly used. 
Route A has the lowest lead times and lowest costs. Hence, it makes sense to continue using Route A has the most commonly used by the company, or even increasing Route A usage. Route C has the 2nd lowest costs and 2nd lowest lead times. Hence, this company should increase the usage of Route C. 

### Quality Analysis 

Haircare products have the highest defect rates while cosmetic products have the lowest defect rates. Skincare is in the middle. 

Products with the lowest manufacturing costs tend to have the lowest defect rate. Products with the highest manufacturing costs have the highest defect rates. This company already spends large amounts of money manufacturing products with high defect rates. Spending more will not reduce the defect rates. Instead, they should try to replicate the manufacturing process of their products with low defect rates. 

### Production Analysis 

Products with low production volume have the highest stock levels while products with medium production volume have the lowest stock levels.

There is a positive correlation between production volume and number of products sold. Products that have the highest sales have the highest production. While products with the lowest sales have the lowest production.
However, when we compare production volume to order quantity (demand), we see that the company is under-producing products that have the highest demand and over-producing products that have the lowest demand. This is because the company is basing their products on past sales, rather than current demand. 

### Conclusion
This company currently loses money on selling skincare and haircare product, while only cosmetics is profitable.
Manufacturing costs are highest for products with lowest retail prices. Company needs to find way to decrease these manufacturing costs or exit these product lines completely. 
Long Lead times are positively correlated with high levels of product availability and stock levels. Hence, long leads teams are resulting in lower demand for products as well as higher carrying costs. Company needs to decrease lead times. 
Company needs to increase usage of sea and rail transportation. Company needs to increase usage of routes A and C. Doing this will result in lower lead times.
Haircare and skincare products have high manufacturing costs and high defect rates. Increasing manufacturing costs won't solve this high defect rate problem. Instead, operators will need to adjust the manufacturing process for lower defect rates of haircare and skincare products. 
Company needs to set production goals on current demand, instead of historical sales. Currently, the company is under-producing products with high market demand and over-producing products with low market demand.
